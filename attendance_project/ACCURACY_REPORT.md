## 🔧 Recommendations for Improvement

### **Immediate Actions (High Priority)**

1. **📸 Improve Image Quality**
   - Use higher resolution photos (minimum 1080p)
   - Ensure good lighting conditions
   - Avoid backlighting or shadows on faces
   - Use photos taken at eye level

2. **🎯 Optimize Detection Parameters**
   - Adjust tolerance settings (currently 0.6)
   - Try different face detection models
   - Test with different image preprocessing

3. **👥 Add More Student Photos**
   - Add photos for students 2024003, 2024004, 2024005
   - Use multiple angles per student (front, side, different expressions)
   - Ensure photos are recent and clear

### **Medium Priority Actions**

4. **🔍 Test with Different Photos**
   - Try the second classroom photo (IMG-20250920-WA0033.jpg)
   - Test with individual student photos
   - Use photos with clear, well-lit faces

5. **⚙️ System Configuration**
   - Consider using 'cnn' model for better accuracy (requires GPU)
   - Adjust face detection scale factor and minimum neighbors
   - Test with different image sizes

### **Long-term Improvements**

6. **📊 Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement real-time accuracy tracking
   - Add confidence threshold tuning
   - Create accuracy dashboards

7. **🔄 Continuous Learning**
   - Implement feedback loop for false positives/negatives
   - Add manual correction capabilities
   - Track accuracy over time
